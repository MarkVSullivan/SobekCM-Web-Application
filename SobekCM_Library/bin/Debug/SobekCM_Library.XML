            <remarks> MySobek Viewers are used for registration and authentication with mySobek, as well as performing any task which requires
            authentication, such as online submittal, metadata editing, and system administrative tasks.<br/><br/>
            During a valid html request, the following steps occur:
            <ul>
            <li>Application state is built/verified by the <see cref="T:SobekCM.Library.Application_State.Application_State_Builder"/> </li>
            <li>Request is analyzed by the <see cref="T:SobekCM.Library.Navigation.SobekCM_QueryString_Analyzer"/> and output as a <see cref="T:SobekCM.Library.Navigation.SobekCM_Navigation_Object"/> </li>
            <li>Main writer is created for rendering the output, in his case the <see cref="T:SobekCM.Library.MainWriters.Html_MainWriter"/> </li>
            <li>The HTML writer will create the necessary subwriter.  If the action requires authentication, an instance of the  <see cref="T:SobekCM.Library.HTML.MySobek_HtmlSubwriter"/> class is created. </li>
            <li>To allow the requested action, the mySobek subwriter will create one of the myUFDC viewers( implementing this class )</li>

             A SerializationWriter instance is used to store values and objects in a byte array.
            
             Once an instance is created, use the various methods to store the required data.
             ToArray() will return a byte[] containing all of the data required for deserialization.
             This can be stored in the SerializationInfo parameter in an ISerializable.GetObjectData() method.
             <para/>
             As an alternative to ToArray(), if you want to apply some post-processing to the serialized bytes, 
             such as compression, call AppendTokenTables first to ensure that the string and object token tables 
             are appended to the stream, and then cast BaseStream to MemoryStream. You can then access the
             MemoryStream's internal buffer as follows:
             <para/>
             <example><code>
             writer.AppendTokenTables();
             MemoryStream stream = (MemoryStream) writer.BaseStream;
            	serializedData = MiniLZO.Compress(stream.GetBuffer(), (int) stream.Length);

            possibility of the same shared object being serialized twice or, if the 
            object has a reference directly or indirectly back to the parent object, 
            there is a risk of looping which will throw an exception.
            
            The type of object is checked with the most common types being checked first.
            Each 'section' can be reordered to provide optimum speed but the check for
            null should always be first and the default serialization always last.
            
            Once the type is identified, a SerializedType byte is stored in the stream
            followed by the data for the object (certain types/values may not require
            storage of data as the SerializedType may imply the value).
            
            For certain objects, if the value is within a certain range then optimized
            storage may be used. If the value doesn't meet the required optimization
            criteria then the value is stored directly.
            The checks for optimization may be disabled by setting the OptimizeForSize
            property to false in which case the value is stored directly. This could 
            result in a slightly larger stream but there will be a speed increate to
            compensate.

            lists are used in a round-robin fashion.

            Returns a byte[] containing all of the serialized data.
            
            The current implementation has the data in 3 sections:
            1) A 4 byte Int32 giving the offset to the 3rd section.
            2) The main serialized data.
            3) The serialized string tokenization lists and object
               tokenization lists.
            
            Only call this method once all of the data has been serialized.
            
            This method appends all of the tokenized data (string and object)
            to the end of the stream and ensures that the first four bytes
            reflect the offset of the tokenized data so that it can be
            deserialized first.
            This is the reason for requiring a rewindable stream.
            
            Future implementations may also allow the serialized data to be
            accessed via 2 byte[] arrays. This would remove the requirement
            for a rewindable stream opening the possibility of streaming the
            serialized data directly over the network allowing simultaneous
            of partially simultaneous deserialization.
